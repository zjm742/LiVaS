## ðŸŒŸ Introduction  
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"Enhancing Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Intent Detection by Reducing Attention Misallocation"**. Our work introduces a novel approach to improve intent detection performance under low-resource and out-of-distribution scenarios by mitigating attention misallocation.  



## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup  
### Requirements  
- Python 3.9  
- CUDA 11.2 

Install dependencies:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  


## ðŸš€ Quick Start  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/zjm742/LiVaS.git 
   cd LiVaS  
   ```  

2. **Run the experiments**:
